                    <p><strong>Registered Agent Service.</strong> If you are a user of the Registered Agent service,
                        VCfilling will act as your registered agent for your applicable State for an initial period of

                        Services. VCfilling will then remove itself as your registered agent, and update all applicable
                        paperwork with the State to appoint the new registered agent. Until VCfilling is notified of
                        your intent to cease using VCfilling as your business’ registered agent pursuant to this section
                        and the successful payment of any cancellation or change of agent fees, VCfilling will continue
                        to serve as your registered agent and bill you on a regular schedule for the Services.</p>

                        upon confirmation that you are in good standing, VCfilling will monitor your State annual
                        report, notify and ensure timely filing of any applicable documfents or fees with the State for
                        an initial period of 12 months. Should you fall into bad standing with the State after VCfilling
                        forms your company or confirms that your entity is in good standing, VCfilling will pay any fees
                        associated with bringing your business back into good standing with the State, including
                        penalties with interest, reinstatement filing fees, but excluding taxes associated with the
                        business. VCfilling is NOT responsible for disenfranchisement or lack of good standing if you
                        did not select Worry Free or your entity was in bad standing PRIOR to engagement of VCfilling’
                        services.</p>

                    <p><em>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</em> All claims and disputes (excluding claims for
                        injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use
                        of any product or service provided by the VCfilling that cannot be resolved informally or in
                        small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the
                        terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings
                        shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the VCfilling, and to
                        any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and
                        assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods
                        provided under the Terms.</p>
                    <p><em>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.</em> Before either party may seek
                        arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute
                        (<strong>“Notice”</strong>) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the
                        requested relief. A Notice to the VCfilling should be sent to: 702 San Antonio Street, 4th
                        Floor, Austin, TX 78701. After the Notice is received, you and the VCfilling may attempt to
                        resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the VCfilling do not resolve the claim or
                        dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an
                        arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be
                        disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award,
                        if any, to which either party is entitled.</p>
                    <p><em>Arbitration Rules.</em> Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration
                        Association (<strong>“AAA”</strong>), an established alternative dispute resolution provider
                        (<strong>“ADR Provider”</strong>) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA
                        is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider.
                        The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not
                        limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such
                        rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (<strong>“Arbitration
                            Rules”</strong>) governing the arbitration are available online at <a
                            href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The
                        arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the
                        total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be
                        resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking
                        relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S.
                        Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration
                        Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you
                        reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside
                        outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time
                        and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
                        entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is
                        greater than the last settlement offer that the VCfilling made to you prior to the initiation of
                        arbitration, the VCfilling will pay you the greater of the award or $1,000.00. Each party shall
                        bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration
                        and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</p>
                    <p><em>Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.</em> If non-appearance based
                        arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based
                        solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the
                        arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or
                        witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</p>
                    <p><em>Time Limits.</em> If you or the VCfilling pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be
                        initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing
                        a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</p>
                    <p><em>Authority of Arbitrator.</em> If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the
                        rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the VCfilling, and the dispute will not be
                        consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator
                        shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The
                        arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary
                        remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.
                        The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential
                        findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages
                        awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a
                        judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you
                        and the VCfilling.</p>
                    <p><em>Waiver of Jury Trial.</em> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS
                        TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims
                        and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration
                        procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a
                        court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should
                        arise between you and the VCfilling in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce
                        an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead
                        electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>
                    <p><em>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</em> ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF
                        THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A
                        CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED
                        JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.</p>
                    <p><em>Confidentiality.</em> All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to
                        the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The
                        parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall
                        not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this
                        Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</p>
                    <p><em>Severability.</em> If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law
                        to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or
                        parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement
                        shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
                    <p><em>Right to Waive.</em> Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration
                        Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not
                        waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
                    <p><em>Survival of Agreement.</em> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your
                        relationship with VCfilling.</p>
                    <p><em>Small Claims Court.</em> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or the VCfilling may bring
                        an individual action in small claims court.</p>
                    <p><strong>Emergency Equitable Relief.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek
                        emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo
                        pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other
                        rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
                    <p><em>Claims Not Subject to Arbitration.</em> Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation,
                        violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other
                        party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration
                        Agreement.</p>
                    <p><strong>Courts.</strong> In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits
                        the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal
                        jurisdiction of the courts located within Travis County, Texas, for such purpose.</p>

                        brought, where the violation occurred, where you may be located or any other jurisdiction.
                        Subject to the Arbitration provision above, you agree and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction
                        of the state or federal courts located in Travis County, Texas and waive any defense of lack of

                        state where any breach by you occurred or where you can be found. You agree that regardless of
